gspread â€” Google Spreadsheets Python library
============================================

gspread is a client library for interacting with `Google Spreadsheets`_.

.. _Google Spreadsheets: http://www.google.com/google-d-s/spreadsheets/

Features
--------

* Open a spreadsheet by its *title*, *url* or *key*.
* Extract range, entire row or column values.
* Independent of Google Data Python client library.

Example
-------

The following code is a Python program that connects to Google Data API
and fetches a cell's value from a spreadsheet::

    import gspread

    gc = gspread.Client(auth=('the.email.address@gmail.com','password'))
    gc.login()

    # Spreadsheets can be opened by their title in Google Docs
    spreadsheet = gc.open('some title')

    # Select worksheet by index
    worksheet = spreadsheet.get_worksheet(0)

    # Get a cell value
    val = worksheet.cell(1, 2).value

The cell's value can be easily updated::

    worksheet.update_cell(1, 2, 'Bingo!')

To fetch a cell range, specify it by common notation::

    cell_list = worksheet.range('A1:A7')

After some processing, this range can be updated in batch::

    for cell in cell_list:
        cell.value = 'O_o'

    worksheet.update_cells(cell_list)
